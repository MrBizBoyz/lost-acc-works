        <p> im alomost done with it here's about it Toy Story 3: The Video Game is a platform game loosely based on the film Toy Story 3. It was published by Disney Interactive Studios (which is the developer for iOS) and developed by Avalanche Software (PS3, Wii, Xbox 360, PC, Mac OS X), Asobo Studio (PS2, PSP) and n-Space (DS). The game was released in North America on June 15, 2010, for the Nintendo DS, Wii, PlayStation Portable, PlayStation 3, Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, and the Xbox 360. A special PlayStation 2 bundle with Toy Story 3: The Video Game was released on October 31, 2010, followed by the game's individual release on November 2, 2010.[1][2]

Toy Story 3 is the first game based on a film by Pixar to be published entirely by Disney Interactive Studios. Past Disney/Pixar movie games have been made in conjunction with Activision first, then THQ.[3] It is the sequel to Toy Story 2: Buzz Lightyear to the Rescue that was based on the second film in the franchise.

Most of the voice cast from the film series returned to reprise their characters in the game with the exception of Tom Hanks (Woody), Tim Allen (Buzz Lightyear) and Kelsey Grammer (Stinky Pete). Jim Hanks returned to voice Woody from the Toy Story 2 game, and Mike MacRae voiced Buzz, while Stephen Stanton replaced Kelsey Grammer as Stinky Pete due to Grammer being unavailable. The game also contains content exclusive to the PlayStation 3 version that allows the player(s) to turn into Zurg in Woody's Roundup.[4] The game was well received by critics and was a top-seller in the UK. This was the last Disney/Pixar game to be released for the PlayStation 2 (which was discontinued a few years later after the game's release) as well as the last PlayStation 2 bundle to be released in both Europe and North America.

The Xbox 360 version of Toy Story 3 became backwards compatible on Xbox One on September 29, 2016.[5]</p>

        <p>Saints Row IV is an open world action-adventure video game developed by Volition and published by Deep Silver. It is the fourth title in the Saints Row series. In the game, the playable character is the leader of the 3rd Street Saints, a street gang that has become the world's most powerful and popular organization, and must fend off an alien invasion after becoming President of the United States and receiving superpowers. The player is free to explore their environment while completing main and side missions at their leisure. The game incorporates elements from science fiction video games and films, and continues the series' reputation for over-the-top parody. It was released in August 2013 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360, and was later ported to PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Linux in 2015.

The game was Volition's first after its sale to Koch Media in early 2013. The supernatural and superpower concept for the game started in Enter the Dominatrix, a cancelled expansion planned for Saints Row: The Third, which the team expanded into Saints Row IV. Volition later released a "director's cut" of Enter the Dominatrix as downloadable content for Saints Row IV alongside How the Saints Saved Christmas, other weapons, costumes, and vehicle packs, and a standalone expansion, Saints Row: Gat out of Hell (which serves as the epilogue to the story). Saints Row IV received several limited and summative edition releases, and was briefly banned in Australia. Critics praised Saints Row IV's humor and character customization options, but criticized for its lack of challenge and reusage of content from The Third.[citation needed] It sold over one million copies in its first week.</p>
